# 📝 To-Do List Application

This is a simple command-line To-Do List application written in C++. It allows users to add tasks, mark tasks as completed, display tasks, sort tasks by priority, and save tasks to a file.

- **💾 Save tasks to a file:** Users can save their to-do list to a file for future reference.

## 📋 Usage

1. Compile the program using a C++ compiler.
2. Run the compiled executable.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to perform various actions such as adding tasks, completing tasks, displaying tasks, sorting tasks, saving tasks to a file, and exiting the application.

## 📝 Input Format

- When adding a task, users need to provide a description, priority level (e.g., high, medium, low), and due date (format: dd/mm/yyyy).
